# Rundown Anarchy

- Hello there! Anarchy is a vanilla rundown featuring diverse dimensions that demand excellent teamwork and gaming skills. This mod is highly challenging, with a focus on close-quarters combat and aggressive gameplay. This design reflects my preference for chaotic battles that require strategic thinking. True to its name, you'll face chaos and challenges that require careful strategy. I've crafted unique and difficult levels inspired by my experiences with Rundowns 6 and 7. The difficulty has been adjusted to exceed R8.

- For the complete Anarchy experience, I recommend playing without using boosters, glitches, cheats, or other mods.

- All levels are possible to clear. My team has completed them without using boosters. There are no secret strategies known only to the developers, so give it your all!

Thank you for playing! Enjoy the fight!

Special thanks to my team (Scotch, Jonino, Cross) and friends.
